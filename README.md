# Identify_Multisource_Catchmets
This code calculates a groundwater and surface water index for UK catchments. This is developed to indicate the source contribution (either surface water of groundwater) to a river flow record. Where both indexes are high (or at least medium) both sources can be assumed to be active and therefore classify the catchment as multisource. This focusses on peak events.
